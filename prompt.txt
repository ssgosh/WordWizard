Please generate a news article with SAT-level vocabulary words, to help a user learn and retain their meanings.
The response should be in JSON format with a title, an array of paragraphs (each with text and a list of highlighted words and their meanings).
Please generate 1 such words per paragraph. Remaining words should be simple and easy to understand for a beginner English speaker.
If your title contains any SAT-level words, those must be used in the text as well, and their meaning should be given. 
Output around 200 words in the article (half a page).
Here is an example of the output JSON format: 
{ 
    "title": "The Title",
    "paragraphs": [
        {
            "text": "Paragraph 1, with a difficult word, such as circumspect",
            "words": {
                "circumspect": "wary and unwilling to take risks",
                } 
        },
        {
            "text": "Paragraph 2, with some more difficult words, such as sanguine and quotidian",
            "words": {
                "sanguine": "optimistic or positive, especially in an apparently bad or difficult situation",
                "quotidian": "Found in the ordinary course of events"
            }
        }
    ]
}
