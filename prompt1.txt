Please generate a a fun and engaging story with SAT-level vocabulary words, to help a user learn and retain their meanings.
The response should be in JSON format with a title, an array of paragraphs (each with text and a list of highlighted words and their meanings).
Please generate 3-4 such words per paragraph.
Surround words by double underscores for the highlights, as __such__.
If your title contains any SAT-level words, those must be used in the text as well, and their meaning should be given. 
Output only at most 400 words in the story.
